# Welcome to my blog

I decided to have my own site, it's powered by NextJS, Vercel, and Forestry as CMS.

Coming up with the domain name was a bit hard, it's very easy to come up with your own name, but I don't like mine enough.

The snacky thing comes from _Brooklyn 99_ TV show, in S01E13, detective Jake Peralta said he gets snacky and I that word stuck to me.

When I'm coding and I get stuck I take a break and have some snacks, and so I called my blog snacky.dev!

I'll be focusing on building some side projects to put into my portfolio which is pretty dead right now.
